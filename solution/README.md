## Project Summary

Create a page that allows users to select a destination from a form. Selectable destinations are filtered from a list of categories based on the season chosen by the user. Once selected, the destination is displayed below the form.

Users will have to run a local server to check out the index.html since CORS doesn't support local json file access. This behavior is normal and is for your safety. Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code could be used as a quick fix. index.html should be responsive.
